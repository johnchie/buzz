NOTE: We have added "Mark this event as Occasions" field for separate occasion events in add event section on admin panel
NOTE: Removed "all","Today","Tommorow", "This week" options from header search because I will create dispute If I select "Today" and select start date as "10 aug 2017" to "15 aug 2017" then which date event system need to display?
